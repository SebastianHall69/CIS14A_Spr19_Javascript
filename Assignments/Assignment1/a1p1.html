    <h1>About Sebastian Hall (A1P1)</h1>
    <p>My name is Sebastian and I like to semi-competitively play pinball and I work<br>
    repairing pinball machines. I enjoy going to school and learning so I always <br/>
    take more classes than necessary. The only assignments I dislike doing are <br/>
    those where I have to write about myself because I never have anything to write.
